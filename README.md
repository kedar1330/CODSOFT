# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains several machine learning projects built using Python, focusing on different areas of data analysis and prediction. Below is a list of the projects included in this repository:

## 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

### Project Overview:
This project involves predicting whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin. The Titanic dataset is used to train and evaluate a machine learning model to make predictions.

### Key Concepts:
- Classification
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Evaluation





## 2. Movie Rating Prediction

### Project Overview:
In this project, the goal is to predict the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors. The project uses regression techniques to predict the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

### Key Concepts:
- Regression
- Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Model Evaluation


## 3. Iris Flower Classification

### Project Overview:
This project involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on sepal and petal measurements. This dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks and is great for learning about machine learning algorithms.

### Key Concepts:
- Classification
- Supervised Learning
- Model Evaluation
